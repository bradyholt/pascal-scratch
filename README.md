pascal-scratch
==============

Collection of my first programs written in Turbo Pascal.  Cira 1995.

Pascal is the first language I learned when begining to program.  A friend of mine got me started and gave me mini 
programming assignments of which many are included here.  Read more about the story of how I got started programming here: http://www.geekytidbits.com/how-i-got-geeky-part-3/

A few highlights:

- MAGIC8.PAS: Magic 8 ball game.  This was my first experience with BGI graphics in Turbo Pacal.
- SPARKLE.PAS: A simple screensaver that I wrote for my boss's computer at Sparkle Car Wash.
